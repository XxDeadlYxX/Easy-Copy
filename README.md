**Update v2.0**

This script will allow you to copy multiple files within many folders and paste them into a specific folder. 
It is best used for copying tons of content in multiple folders instead of doing it 1 by 1. 



File Copier 2.0 is an enhanced version of File Copier. It allows you to select multiple folders ***from multiple paths***. 

- Works by moving (copying) all files from the selected folder's (**source path**) and moving (pasting) them to a different selected folder's (**destination path**) which could save some time instead of selecting files 1 by 1.

- With the same functionality of the original File Copier.

- It also shows the log for all moved files (may require lots of scrolling if you're up to it.)

*The script options will look like this with these options*:

*PS: this script will copy duplicate named files and paste them, since some files in different folders might have the same names but different content, with a modified name that shows it was a **copy***

Here is an example of this situation:
